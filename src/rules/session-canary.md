# Session Canary

A canary in a coal mine stops singing before the air turns dangerous. This
rule gives the user the same early-warning signal for context degradation:
two small, always-expected reply markers whose **silent disappearance** tells
the user the conversation is degrading and it is time for a fresh session —
long before the agent visibly starts making mistakes.

Read `personal.canary_name` from `.agent-settings.yml`. Empty or missing →
rule is inert.

## The Iron Law

```
personal.canary_name SET → THE FIRST REPLY OF EVERY NEW TASK OPENS BY
ADDRESSING THE USER BY THAT NAME, AND EVERY WORK REPLY KEEPS THE
REPLY-CLOSE MARKERS ALIVE (ONE END-SUMMARY; PR CREATED/UPDATED THIS TURN
→ RAW URL AS THE LITERAL LAST LINE).
NEVER FAKE CONTINUITY — A DROPPED CANARY IS SURFACED, NOT PAPERED OVER.
```

## The two canaries

1. **Opening canary** — the first reply of the session AND the first reply of
   each new task within it (per the `user-interrupt-priority` task buckets)
   opens by addressing the user by name — one natural mention, in the user's
   language. Intermediate replies of the same task do **not** re-greet.
2. **Closing canary** — the reply-close contract, restated here as a liveness
   marker (canonical: [`direct-answers`](direct-answers.md) Iron Law 3 +
   [`reply-close-mechanics`](../contexts/communication/rules-auto/reply-close-mechanics.md)):
   a work reply ends with ONE compact end-summary, and a PR created or updated
   this turn puts its raw URL as the **literal last line**.

## Honesty clause

If you notice a canary was dropped (a task-start reply without the greeting, a
work reply without its close), do not silently resume as if nothing happened —
name it and suggest a fresh session or `/agent-handoff`, per
[`context-hygiene`](context-hygiene.md).

## When NOT to fire

- `personal.canary_name` empty or missing — fully inert, no greeting.
- Intermediate replies inside an ongoing task (greeting only at task start).
- The greeting never substitutes for substance — it prefixes the answer, it is
  not the answer.

## Enforcement

> **Enforced by:** [`scripts/session_canary_hook.ts`](../../scripts/session_canary_hook.ts)
> (`session_start`, all hook-capable hosts) — injects the `<session-canary>`
> contract block into every new session, so a fresh conversation cannot start
> without it. **Copilot fallback:** no hook surface — this rule is the only
> carrier; re-read it when the trigger fires.
