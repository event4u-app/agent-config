## Startup contract

- **When:** screenshot created/embedded in docs or landing in docs/media/
- **Must:** anonymize before it ships: real names, addresses, birthdates, phones, secrets/tokens/keys, real emails (not @example.{com,org,net}/fake-data domain), identity paths, client/project IDs, internal hosts, GDPR-sensitive, counts revealing real users · no-data image: embed w/ one-line justification · data-bearing: screenshot-hygiene workflow, then this-turn human confirmation before embed
- **Never:** ship screenshot w/ unredacted sensitive data · detection as clearance (gate = human confirmation) · terminal/CLI/IDE screenshots; use text block w/ text redaction · maintainer's real name, even beside handle · uncertain → redact or refuse; never ship-and-hope.
- **Except:** fake data (Max Mustermann, @example.com) · maintainer's own public handle + paths under it · screenshots.identity_allowlist (default empty: all identities human-decided) · not image generation, user-supplied screenshot used only as design spec, non-doc surfaces.
