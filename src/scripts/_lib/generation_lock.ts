/**
 * A file or directory lock whose stale-break never removes a path another
 * caller may hold.
 *
 * Measured by `tests/scripts/generation_lock_interleavings.test.ts`; every
 * site that uses it by `tests/scripts/lock_sites_interleavings.test.ts`.
 *
 * The guard is a family `<guard>`, `<guard>.1`, `<guard>.2`, …: generation 0 is
 * the bare path each caller passes, which is the name its stat-then-remove lock
 * used, so a process still running that older code sees a first-generation
 * holder. The holder is whoever created the highest generation. Acquiring creates generation 0 when
 * none exists; breaking a stale highest generation `g` creates `g + 1` with
 * `O_EXCL` — two breakers race on one name, so exactly one wins — and only the
 * winner then removes the generations below its own, by name. A release never
 * removes anything: it ages the caller's own generation to the epoch, so the
 * next caller supersedes it at once and generation numbers never restart. After
 * every create the caller checks that no higher generation exists, and backs
 * off if one does.
 *
 * The protocol is written as a sequence of filesystem steps (`acquireSteps`)
 * so the interleaving harness can run several callers step by step against a
 * real directory; `tryAcquire` drives the same steps synchronously.
 *
 * What it does not do: a holder paused past the stale threshold keeps running
 * after a peer superseded it. That is a lease without fencing, and no lock
 * without a fenced write closes it.
