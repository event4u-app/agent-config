# /roadmap:process-full

Whole-roadmap execution scope of the [`/roadmap`](../roadmap.md)
cluster. Same canonical loop as
[`/roadmap:process-phase`](process-phase.md), but does **not** stop at
phase boundaries — continues until every step is closed (or a halt
condition fires).

## Instructions

Run the canonical loop in
[`contexts/execution/roadmap-process-loop`](../../contexts/execution/roadmap-process-loop.md)
with the **scope delta below**.

## Scope delta

- **Working set:** every open step across every phase, in document
  order. Phase-internal annotations like `(deferred)` / `(optional)` /
  "gated on Phase N" do not narrow the working set.
- **Stop after:** the entire roadmap reaches `count_open == 0`, or a
  halt condition fires (Hard-Floor, council-off + ambiguity,
  security-sensitive, scope-out-of-roadmap, test/quality red).
- **Phase boundary handling:** at every phase boundary, run the
  per-phase quality pipeline when `quality_cadence: per_phase` (or
  `per_step`). On red → stop, surface, do **not** silently roll into
  the next phase.
- **Final archival:** when the roadmap is fully closed, run the
  archival check from
  [`roadmap-process-loop § 6`](../../contexts/execution/roadmap-process-loop.md#6-final-report-and-archival).

## Iron Law — Full is Full

```
/roadmap:process-full PROCESSES EVERY OPEN STEP IN THE FILE.
PHASE-INTERNAL "(DEFERRED)" / "(OPTIONAL)" / "GATED ON PHASE X"
NOTES DO NOT NARROW THE WORKING SET. ONLY THE FIVE HALT CONDITIONS
STOP THE RUN.
```

Phase-internal `(deferred)` / `(optional)` / `gated on Phase N` tags are
authoring annotations, not execution gates. `/roadmap:process-full`
ignores them by construction. If the user wants narrower execution they
invoke `/roadmap:process-phase` (scope = single phase) or
`/roadmap:process-step` (scope = single step) instead.

Time-boxed plate / horizon framing is forbidden in roadmaps by template
rule 16 (`templates/roadmaps.md`). If a legacy roadmap still carries
such phrasing, treat it as ordinary prose — never as a gate.

## Iron Law — Real-time dashboard

```
EVERY DONE STEP FLIPS [ ] → [x] BEFORE THE LOOP MOVES TO THE NEXT STEP.
DASHBOARD REGENERATES IN THE SAME REPLY THAT FLIPPED THE BOX.
NO BATCH FLIP AT THE ARCHIVE COMMIT. NO "I'LL DO IT AT THE END."
```

`/roadmap:process-full` is the worst offender for batching because it
runs continuously across many steps. Flipping all 13 boxes in the
single archive commit defeats the dashboard's purpose — the user
loses progress visibility for the entire run. Per Iron Law 2 of
[`roadmap-progress-sync`](../../rules/roadmap-progress-sync.md): the
flip + regen pair is atomic with the step's work, executed inside
[`roadmap-process-loop § 5`](../../contexts/execution/roadmap-process-loop.md#5-step-loop)
step 5.

## Rules

- **No silent acceleration past a halt.** Every halt condition stops
  the run; the user resumes on the next turn.
- **No silent stop at an authoring annotation.** Encountering
  "gated on Phase N", "deferred", "optional", or any equivalent
  phase-internal annotation is **not** a halt condition. Continue.
- **No silent batch flip.** Each step's checkbox flips in the same
  reply that lands its work — never deferred to the archive commit.
- **Phase quality pipeline runs at every phase boundary** when cadence
  is `per_phase` or `per_step`. `end_of_roadmap` skips per-phase and
  runs only at the final archival check.
- All other rules from
  [`process-phase § Rules`](process-phase.md#rules) apply unchanged.
