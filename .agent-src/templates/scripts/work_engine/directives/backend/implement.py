"""``implement`` step — gate + Option-A delegation for applying the plan.

The step never edits files. Editing is delegated to the agent via
``@agent-directive: apply-plan``; the agent runs the `minimal-safe-
diff` and `scope-control` rules while it applies the plan, then
writes the resulting file-level changes onto ``state.changes`` and
marks ``outcomes['implement'] = 'success'`` before re-invoking the
dispatcher.

Flow:

- ``plan`` outcome is not ``success`` → BLOCKED on precondition.
- ``state.changes`` empty → BLOCKED with ``@agent-directive:
  apply-plan`` so the agent applies the plan.
- ``state.changes`` populated but malformed (entries missing
  ``path``, or non-dict entries) → BLOCKED with shape complaint.
- Otherwise → SUCCESS.

``changes`` entries use the loose shape described in
``agents/contexts/implement-ticket-flow.md#deliverystate-the-only-shared-object``
\u2014 each entry is a dict with at least a ``path``; optional
``lines`` / ``purpose`` feed the delivery report.
