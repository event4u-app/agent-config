# Review branch drain/road-to-self-modification-20261018x, round 1 — the ratification gate prints the user's question

Step 5.2 of `road-to-self-modification-that-a-council-must-pass`, proposed on its own. It changes `src/scripts/check_kernel_edit_ratified.ts`, which is the ratification gate itself (gated), and adds one paragraph to `docs/contracts/ratification-artifact.md` (not gated) and one test file.

What the change does: `docs/contracts/ratification-artifact.md` § "When the user decides" says that when the council cannot pass a change, the run stops with one question for the user: the council's recommendation, the dissent, the exact change, what it is expected to gain, what it risks, and how it is undone. The gate now prints that block (`escalationMessage`, first line `ESCALATION_HEADING`) when it can see such a case:

- a record with verdict `refused` or `non-convergent`;
- a record whose only problem is `diversity-required` (fewer distinct providers than the policy requires);
- any diff touching the ratification mechanism itself (`gated.self`), whether or not the record passes.

It fills in the verdict, the non-passing seats and the gated paths, and states that it does not know the expected gain, risk or rollback. It prints nothing for authoring defects (no record, malformed, self-ratified, stale `subject`). The exit code of every path is unchanged; only output lines are added. The subject digest of this diff's gated content at `fc3a0a2eb` is `69959bfb0cb0b1f3fd0526b14e355b25f4e3191d99828d1a163699989edec41a`, covering `src/scripts/check_kernel_edit_ratified.ts`.

Answer, for this diff: what behaviour changes, including what follows from it; which authority or safety boundary becomes wider or narrower; whether the change weakens anything that judges it — a test, a gate, a threshold, this review; whether another host or projection is left as a way around it; whether it can be undone and how; what observation would show the claimed benefit to be false; whether a smaller change would do; what it adds to standing instruction weight; whether untrusted content could steer the path (record text is printed into CI output).

Report any defect with file:line, the failure scenario and a severity. Close with exactly one stance line: `ratified`, `confirmed-non-expanding`, or `refused`.

+`check_kernel_edit_ratified` prints that question when it can see the case: on
+a `refused` or `non-convergent` record, on a record short only of provider
+diversity, and on any change to the ratification mechanism itself, ratified or
+not (the exit code is unchanged — the escalation is information, the verdict
+is still the record's). It fills in the verdict, the dissenting seats and the
+gated paths, and asks for the expected gain, the risk and the rollback, which
+it does not know. It stays silent on an authoring defect — no record, a
+self-ratified one, a stale `subject` — because that is not the user's question.
+Whether a different provider was tried (condition 1) and whether a row of
+the owner-reserved table is touched (condition 3) are judgements the gate
+cannot make from a diff; a run states them itself.
