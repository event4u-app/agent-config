# Roadmap Stubs — successor placeholders

> **Status** · stubs only. Created by Phase 9 of
> [`road-to-employee-product-and-external-proof.md`](../archive/road-to-employee-product-and-external-proof.md)
> so cross-references from the deployment-posture document and the
> archived `road-to-internal-ai-os-deployment.md` resolve.

Each file in this directory is an **empty-named placeholder**. None
of them is active work. Each enumerates the prerequisites a future
maintainer (or external contributor with funding) must satisfy
before the stub can be promoted to an active roadmap.

The stubs live under `stubs/` (not `agents/roadmaps/*.md` directly)
so they do not register with `task lint-roadmap-complexity` and do
not appear on `agents/roadmaps-progress.md`. Promotion to active
status moves the file up one directory and adds the complexity
frontmatter expected by the linter.

## Current stubs

| Stub | Triggers org-mode surface | Gates |
|---|---|---|
| [`road-to-team-sso.md`](road-to-team-sso.md) | SSO / OIDC sign-on | Recruited customer + funded security audit |
| [`road-to-central-policy.md`](road-to-central-policy.md) | Central policy enforcement | SSO must land first |
| [`road-to-team-context.md`](road-to-team-context.md) | Team-shared overrides server | Small-team-recipe (git overrides) hits scale limits |
| [`road-to-internal-connectors.md`](road-to-internal-connectors.md) | OAuth connectors (Google, Slack, M365) | Org customer agrees to per-connector scope review |

## Promotion criteria (shared)

Any stub may move from `stubs/` to `agents/roadmaps/` only when **all
three** of these are true:

1. A real first customer has been recruited and is named in
   `agents/recruit-sessions/<role>/`. No speculative promotion.
2. A funded, human-reviewed security audit covers the surface the
   stub introduces.
3. A current maintainer signs off on lifting the Hard-Floor item
   the stub crosses, in a written ADR.

Until then, the answer to "team X when?" is the cancelled-with-reason
matrix in [`docs/deploy/team-deployment-posture.md`](../../../docs/deploy/team-deployment-posture.md).
