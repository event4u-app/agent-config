## Startup contract

- **When:** user intake trigger arrived (TRIGGER_PHRASES, ai_council/low_impact_intake.ts) · entry about to reach corpus · /memory learn-low-impact preview; locked (even while absent): agents/decisions/low-impact-decisions.md + data/low-impact-decisions-seed.md.
- **Must:** NO ENTRY LEAVES THE PROJECT REPO UNTIL THE REDACTOR CLEARS IT → run redact_low_impact_entry.ts at write gate (every intake append) + review gate (every learn-low-impact preview).
- **Never:** entry w/ secrets (raw-key prefixes, inline api_key: shape), emails, project-rooted paths, customer/tenant names, internal hostnames, monetary amounts, business SQL identifiers, inline code > 40 chars (generic placeholders <customer>/<tenant>/<account>/<user> survive) · auto-rewrite, silently retry or promote a refused entry (name it).
- **Stop:** gate fails → refuse operation, emit "> Low-impact corpus refused — <category>: <masked, N chars>. Rephrase or skip." (category + match length only, for every class: never echo the matched secret/PII or any matched value), ask user to rephrase, stop intake/upstream flow.
