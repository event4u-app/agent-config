# Changelog

All notable changes to `event4u/agent-config` are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning policy is documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#versioning-policy).
Entry-shape contract: [`docs/contracts/CHANGELOG-conventions.md`](docs/contracts/CHANGELOG-conventions.md).

> Entries before 1.3.3 were reconstructed from git history after the fact.
> Early releases did not maintain release notes.
>
> History is split into **eras**. The current era keeps full entries
> inline; prior eras collapse into a single pointer to an archive file
> under [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/). A drift test
> (`tests/lib/changelog_eras.test.ts`) forces an era split before the
> current era grows past 250 lines.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Docs hygiene — retired stale authoring-source pointers.** 43 stale
  "edit `.agent-src.uncondensed/`" *authoring* pointers across 28 `.md` files
  repointed at `src/` (the authoring source of truth per ADR-051); continues
  the #989 README/thin-root fixes. `check_source_pointer_freshness`'s allowlist
  broadened (2 → 16 files) to lock the cleaned files against regression. Live
  `.agent-src.uncondensed/` **code constants, pipeline descriptions, and
  catalog paths were deliberately left untouched** — that tree is a live
  generated intermediate, not dead debt; a blind sweep was explicitly rejected.

### Added

- **Internet-reach operator tooling** — upstream-tool health and install-pinning
  discipline for the tools a reach recipe needs. The router skill this was
  scoped around was **cancelled pre-authoring by its own benchmark gate**: the
  pre-registered run returned 0/12 outright wins against the host's native web
  tools (`band: stop`), so no skill, no triggers, no capability-area claim. The
  null is published in [`docs/benchmark.md`](docs/benchmark.md) § internet-reach;
  the decision is [ADR-126](docs/decisions/ADR-126-internet-reach-operator-tooling.md).
  - `reach:doctor` — new read-only command: per-channel probe status,
    `active_backend`, tier, lifecycle, and the exact **pinned** fix command for
    the current platform when a backend is missing or broken. No writes, no
    installs, no network (`--deep` is the explicit opt-in that makes one real
    request per backend and still writes nothing).
  - `src/config/reach-channels.yml` + `reach-channels.schema.json` — ordered
    backend candidates per channel (swapping a backend is a config reorder, not
    a code edit), the four-value lifecycle vocabulary reused from
    `provider-lifecycle`, `last_verified` staleness metadata, and an install
    pattern that **rejects** unpinned versions, `latest`/`main`/`HEAD` refs and
    archive-URL install sources.
  - `tool_probe` — five-state probe taxonomy (`ok`/`missing`/`broken`/`timeout`/
    `error`) with stale-shim detection (resolvable shim, dead interpreter),
    exit-126/127 mapping, timeout-only single retry, and per-channel error
    isolation. Every spawn routes through `hardenedSpawnEnv()`.
  - `check-reach-channels` + `check-reach-prescriptions` CI gates — pinning and
    intake-record discipline is machine-checked, not an honour system; a
    prescription that cannot be pinned does not ship.
  - `check-reach-staleness` CI gate — offline: a channel unverified for >90 days,
    a `deprecated` channel with no `replacement`, or a channel past its
    `removal_after` date and still present fails the build.
  - Registry trust is enforced at runtime, not just in CI: `reach:doctor` (incl.
    `--registry <path>`) validates the registry against its schema and refuses to
    probe on any violation (exit 2). `probe_args` is a flag-shaped **allowlist**
    and `probe_cmd` must equal its backend `id`, so a registry entry can neither
    smuggle a shell payload nor label a row with a binary other than the one that
    ran — both closed by an adversarial pre-merge review, with permanent
    regression fixtures.

- **Doc-follows-code discipline** — deterministic, framework-agnostic mechanism
  so documentation is updated when code changes.
  - `downstream-changes` rule gains a first-class **Doc-Impact** obligation:
    a change to a public surface (route, exported signature, CLI flag, config/
    settings key, env var, DB schema, event payload) is incomplete until the
    doc that describes it is updated in the same change; escape hatch for
    refactor-only / no-surface changes.
  - `agent-docs-writing` skill: the advisory doc-sync table becomes an
    actionable, cross-stack Doc-Impact procedure with a falsifiable-claim
    fire/no-fire test.
  - `check_source_pointer_freshness` CI gate — fails when an authoring file
    names the retired `.agent-src.uncondensed/` tree as source of truth.
  - Opt-in consumer CI template `github-workflows/doc-impact.yml` (warn-first,
    `[docs:not-needed]` / `refactor:` escape hatch, `STRICT` toggle).

### Fixed

- **Every release PR was red on its first run — the generator and the
  highlight gate contradicted each other.** `release.ts` wrote `_none_` into
  all five curated-head fields; `check_release_highlights` (added 2026-08-03)
  fails a `_none_` the release span contradicts. Because every release of this
  package touches `src/rules/` or `src/scripts/schemas/`, "Behaviour changes"
  is *always* substantiated, so the gate reliably red-flagged the generator's
  own default — 9.17.0 (run 30871194277) and 9.18.0 (run 30909511315) both
  failed on that one step, and each release had to be unblocked by hand.
  - The span → category classifier now lives once, in
    `src/scripts/_lib/release_highlights.ts`, and is shared by the generator
    and the gate; the two duplicated label lists are gone with it.
  - `release.ts` **pre-fills** each substantiated label with the deriving
    reason plus its citing SHAs (capped at 6, remainder stated, never silently
    truncated). `_none_` is now a fallback for labels the span does not
    substantiate, not a blanket default — so the tool no longer asserts five
    things it never checked.
  - The gate keeps full teeth for the failure it was actually built for: a
    **human** editing a substantiated line back down to `_none_`, which is what
    produced the false 9.13.0 and 9.14.0 heads. An unrewritten auto-derived
    line is advisory (a prose gap, not a false claim) and never blocks.
  - Derivation is best-effort in the generator: a git failure degrades to the
    `_none_` skeleton with a warning instead of aborting a release.

- **`/team delegate` double gate is now enforced in code, not only in prose**
  (team mode stays default-off; closing `road-to-team-mode`). The gate on the
  only write-access wrapper existed as agent-followed instructions in the
  command doc — nothing mechanical checked `ai_team.allow_delegate`, and no
  test covered any of the three flag combinations. Added
  `assert_delegate_allowed()` + `TeamDelegateDisabledError` in
  `src/scripts/ai_team/team_dispatch.ts` (mirroring the existing
  `run_team_review` fail-closed shape) plus a `--delegate-gate` CLI mode that
  exits non-zero with the opt-in pointer unless **both** `ai_team.enabled` and
  `ai_team.allow_delegate` are true; all three combinations are test-pinned.
- **Default-off parity for team mode is now pinned where it was only
  claimed**: the Stop-hook E2E covered `enabled: true` + `managed: false`
  only, so the shipped default posture (`ai_team` absent, or
  `enabled: false`) was never exercised — two new pins assert a strict no-op
  (exit 0, no stdout, no state, no ledger). The command-suggestion surface
  gained its own pin (exactly one eligible team command, its
  `trigger_context` carrying the `ai_team.enabled is true` agent-side
  precondition, all sub-commands ineligible, and zero `ai_team` awareness in
  the deterministic suggester — so its output is invariant with respect to
  that config).
- Stale `not yet manifest-wired` header comments in
  `src/scripts/ai_team/review_gate.ts` and
  `src/scripts/team_review_gate_hook.ts`: the Stop-concern registration
  landed with team-mode Phase 4 (`hook_manifest.yaml`, claude `stop` chain),
  so the comments told a reviewer auditing default-off that the hook was
  still inert.
- Source-of-truth pointer drift: `src/agent-src/README.md` and the
  `agents-md-thin-root` skill named the retired `.agent-src.uncondensed/`
  tree; corrected to `src/`.
- **Embed-contract docs completed + de-drifted**
  ([`docs/contracts/local-server-ports.md`](docs/contracts/local-server-ports.md),
  [`docs/contracts/local-server-api.md`](docs/contracts/local-server-api.md)):
  the host-facing contract now carries the framing-DENY council reasoning, the
  `local-server.json` discovery-file rules (`url` embeds `?token=` — hosts
  rebuild from `port` + a fresh token read; `0600` is a contract invariant),
  the `?token=` accepted-risk statement, the wizard-out-of-scope-for-embed-v1
  note, and a Host-lifecycle section (idle-shutdown watchdog + keepalive,
  headless refusal). `local-server-api.md` had three stale claims corrected:
  the token IS persisted (`local-server.token`, mode `0600`) — not
  "never written to disk"; headless `ui:serve` refuses with exit 2 — it does
  not silently boot browserless; the ping example now shows the
  `capabilities` block. Plus an explicit `capabilities.embed` assertion in
  `tests/server/app.test.ts`. Closes `road-to-ac-embeddable-gui`.
